It's possible to argue that this book hasn't accomplished much. Afterall, it
doesn't present any algorithms or programming techniques that haven't been used
before. It doesn't give a rigorous method for designing systems, nor does it
develop a new theory of designâ€”it just documents existing designs. You could
conclude that it makes a reasonable tutorial, perhaps, but it certainly can't
offer much to an experienced object-oriented designer.

We hope you think differently. Cataloging design patterns is important. It gives
us standard names and definitions for the techniques we use. If we don't study
design patterns in software, we won't be able to improve them, and it'll be
harder to come up with new ones.

This book is only a start. It contains some of the most common design patterns
that expert object-oriented designers use, and yet people hear and learn about
them solely by word of mouth or by studying existing systems. Early drafts of
the book prompted other people to write down the design patterns they use, and
it should prompt even more in its current form. We hope this will mark the start
of a movement to document the expertise of software practitioners.

This chapter discusses the impact we think design patterns will have, how they
are related to other work in design, and how you can get involved in finding and
cataloging patterns.
